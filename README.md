# Terminus Server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/terminusdb/terminus-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/terminusdb/terminus-server)

TerminusDB is an open source model driven graph database for knowledge
graph representation designed specifically for the web-age.

Terminus Server provides TerminusDB with a RESTful API for interacting
with knowledge graphs via the JSON-LD exchange format. This means you
can easily string together applications within your own toolchain
which utilise the powerful features of graph search and graph storage.

We use an advanced git-like model storing append only changes to
graphs represented in concise datastructures using [terminus-store](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-store).

## Latest Version 

v1.1.1

## Getting Started

### Install from Docker image (*RECOMMENDED*)

#### Linux Users

For Linux we recommend you use our [Quickstart](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-quickstart) installer.

#### Windows & Mac Users 

To install a docker image with the latest server follow the instructions here: [running the terminus-server from docker](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-server/blob/master/docs/DOCKER.md).

### Building from source

In order to build from source, follow the [build from source](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-server/blob/master/docs/BUILD.md) directions. 

### Open Console

Once you have installed terminus-server either from the docker image or built from source you can go simply enter the server location into your browser to view your database from the dashboard "http://SERVER:PORT/console". (the default is: <a href=""http://localhost:6363/console"" target="_blank">"http://localhost:6363/console"</a>).

## Documentation 

### Microservices API

Terminus Server is organised to be _web native_ which means that all
actions and activities are easily automated via a RESTful JSON-LD API.

The Server API is documented [here](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-server/blob/master/docs/API.md).

### WOQL 

WOQL, the Web Object Query Language, allows you to seemlessly traverse the graph extracting graph 
fragments, nodes, tables or JSON-LD documents. The syntax itself is in JSON-LD, making the syntax 
a native data-structure in JavaScript, Python, and Prolog.

The Syntax is documented [here](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-server/blob/master/docs/SYNTAX.md).

## Why 

TerminusDB will: 

* Make complex data models easy, maintainable and enforced. 
* Overcome the Object Impedance mismatch without turning your Database into an incomprehensible soup. 
* Allow you to search for repeating patterns using recursion. 
* Give you powerful temporal queries using finite domain constraint logic. 
* Enable the sharing of data using linked open data formats RDF and JSON-LD making scientific or organisational information sharing easy.
* Help you automate the production of UI and data-entry by *knowing* what data *means*.

## Client

In order to begin manipulating and querying your database you can
simply point your browser to `TERMINUS_DIR/index.html` which should
allow you to manage and query your database.

You can also perform all configuration, querying and management
functions via the RESTful API. We have a number of client libraries to
help you get started:

The [JavaScript client libraries](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-client) give you 
assistance with programatic access.

The [JavaScript dashboard](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-dashboard) is an example 
application allowing manipulation of the database, queries and .

The [Python client libraries] Coming Soon...

## Changes in this Version 

* Now with our own [terminus-store](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-store) backend!
* Extended WOQL to greater functionality for string and arithmetic processing
* Better date handling in WOQL
* Improved type casting in WOQL 
* Improvements to query processing speed

## Future 

We are working hard on our collaboration and data-ops features. They
should be available by the end of February 2020.

## TODO

* Improve error handling and logging
* Convert frames into valid JSON-LD
