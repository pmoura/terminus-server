# Build From Source

[Debian / Ubuntu](#debian-or-ubuntu)

[Fedora / Red Hat](#fedora-or-red-hat)

[Arch Linux](#arch-linux)

## Debian or Ubuntu

The following directions should work on debian or ubuntu.

### Rust

Install Rust by following the following instructions on the official
Rust installation guide.

https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

### SWIPL

To use Terminus Server, you will need the SWIPL installation of
prolog. To install this in Debian variants simply use the apt package
manager:

```
apt install swi-prolog
```
Once installed, you will have to install two library dependencies from SWIPL.

This can be done by typing:

```
$ swipl
Welcome to SWI-Prolog (threaded, 64 bits, version 8.1.10-28-g8a26a53c1)
SWI-Prolog comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. This is free software.
Please run ?- license. for legal details.

For online help and background, visit http://www.swi-prolog.org
For built-in help, use ?- help(Topic). or ?- apropos(Word).

1 ?- pack_install(terminus_store_prolog).
% Contacting server ....
```

### Terminus Server

The Terminus Server source tree should then be cloned from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-server
cd terminus-server
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

You need to set the admin user password which is used as a
super-user API key for access. This can be done with the
`db_util` script. The script should also be used to
configure the server name, as shown in the example.

```
utils/db_util -k "my_password_here" -s "my_server_name_here"
```

At this point you can enter the terminusDB directory and start the server:

```
./start.pl
```

Now you are ready to interact with the HTTP server.

## Fedora or Red Hat

These instructions have been tested on Fedora 30 and might result in different results depending on your
Fedora / Red Hat release.


### Rust

Install Rust by following the following instructions on the official
Rust installation guide.

https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

### SWIPL

SWI-Prolog is needed to run terminus-server. Install SWI-PROLOG with:

```
sudo dnf install pl pl-devel
```

### SWIPL libraries

Run SWIPL and install the required dependencies, note that you need to have
rust installed to compile the dependencies:

```
$ swipl

```

At this point you can enter the terminusDB directory and start the server:

```
./start.pl
```

Now you are ready to interact with the HTTP server.


## Arch Linux


### Rust

Install Rust by following the following instructions on the official
Rust installation guide.

https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

### Library dependencies

1. Install all dependencies of all the required libraries:

```
sudo pacman -S git swi-prolog make automake autoconf libtool zlib pkgconf gcc
```

### SWIPL libraries

Run SWIPL and install the required dependencies, note that you need to have
rust installed to compile the dependencies:

```
$ swipl
